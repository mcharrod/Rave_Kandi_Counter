Rave Kandi Counter App 


Rave Kandi is a special tradition for festival goers. You can learn more about Rave Kandi by clicking [this link](https://www.iheartraves.com/blogs/post/how-to-trade-kandi-at-a-rave). This is a bead counter app to help you make Rave kandi! When making Kandi, it can be difficult to keep track of how many beads you've put down, especially for more intricate designs. 

To use the app, all you have to do is hit the increment button to keep track of how many beads you have put down already. When you move onto another row or color, hit "save" and the counter will reset to zero, and log the previous count.
